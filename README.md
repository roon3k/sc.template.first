# Project Overview

This project is part of a larger product management system designed to handle API requests and frontend functionalities. The primary goal is to generate a mini-app within Telegram that allows users to interact with products via a Telegram bot.

## Project Structure

- **Backend (Node.js, Express):** Handles API requests, database interactions, and business logic.
- **Frontend (React):** Provides the user interface for interacting with the product management system.
- **Telegram Bot:** Integrates with the Telegram API to create a mini-app for user interactions.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## API Integration

The backend of this project is built with Node.js and Express. It handles API requests for product management and interacts with the database to fetch and update product information. 

### Setting Up Backend

1. **Navigate to the backend directory:**
    ```sh
    cd backend
    ```

2. **Install backend dependencies:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3. **Start the backend server:**
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```

## Frontend Integration

The frontend is built with React, providing a user-friendly interface for managing products.

### Setting Up Frontend

1. **Navigate to the frontend directory:**
    ```sh
    cd frontend
    ```

2. **Install frontend dependencies:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3. **Start the frontend development server:**
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```

## Telegram Bot Integration

This project includes a Telegram bot that integrates with the Telegram API to generate a mini-app for product management.

### Setting Up Telegram Bot

1. **Ensure the `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` is configured in your backend.**
2. **The backend server handles interactions with the Telegram API and serves the mini-app to users.**
